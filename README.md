# Jotto Game Site

## About
This is a web-based implementation of the classic word game Jotto, built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js).

## What is Jotto?
Jotto is a word game where two players attempt to guess each other's secret word. The secret word is a 5-letter word chosen by each player at the start of the game. Players take turns guessing words, and after each guess, they are told how many letters their guess has in common with the opponent's secret word. The player who guesses the opponent's word first is the winner.

## Rules of Jotto
1. Each player starts the game by choosing a 5-letter secret word.
2. Players take turns guessing 5-letter words.
3. After each guess, the player is told how many letters their guessed word has in common with the opponent's secret word. This is called the "Jotto number".
4. The game continues until a player correctly guesses the opponent's secret word.

## Tech Stack
This Jotto game site is built using the MERN stack:
- MongoDB: A source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program.
- Express.js: A back end web application framework for Node.js.
- React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Node.js: A back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.
